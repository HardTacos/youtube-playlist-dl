Contribution
============

The preferred communication method for everything relating to this code is by submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-youtube/issues).
Because of the public nature others can join, follow or lookup the conversation which imho would be a good thing.

Below are rules and guidelines for efficient handling of your contributions. This way you help me to keep things organized and simple.

* Public contact: https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-youtube/issues (preferred)

Contributing code
-----------------

* You can submit your code bits in a Pull Request.
* I will **not** grant you direct write access to this repository or the [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/youtube-feeds).
* Each feature or group of changes must have its own git commit. I'd rather have lots of commits for one change than one commit for unrelated parts.
* **TEST** your code before submission, do not exclusively rely on what Github or Travis CI tell you about the quality.
* Describe your changes in the Pull Request.
* Use the syntax style of the rest of the code.

* You release the code under the same license as this repository.
* You know for sure your Pull Request or anything it contains won't conflict with this license.
* You do not earn credits, points or status by contributing.
* You are aware your code may not be (completely) used.

However, your time and efforts are greatly appreciated!
